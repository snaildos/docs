<h1>How to install a Discord Bot on this service?</h1>
<figure class="image"><img src="./images/ss.png">
  <figcaption>Follow the instructions below</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol>
  <li>You should be familiar with Git, if not, you will have a hard time.</li>
  <li>On your git repo address, type in your GitHub Repo URL, install branch can/should always be master. Leave User uploaded files and Auo Update to default. On your Git USERNAME, type your username.</li>
  <li>For the service to function properly, type your github acess token. For github: https://github.com/settings/tokens type that URL, press “generate” and then copy and paste it in. No documentary exists for GitLab currently.</li>
  <li>After that, return to console and hit “start”. In a matter of minutes, your bot will start. Give your bot about 10-20 mins to load up for the first time.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Trouble-shooting</h1>
<p>As a support technician in SnailDOS, I see many people stuff these things up.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Invalid Bot Token</li>
  <li>The GitHub username, repo, or token is invalid, therefor, nothing is being cloned.</li>
  <li>People have no idea how basic linux works, and get confused.</li>
  <li>People who don't read the docs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you an idea on what I don't want to see. Anyone who wastes my time, <strong>will</strong> get banned from our services.</p>
