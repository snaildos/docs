# Creatable Guide
## Terminology
Welcome to Creatable host, let's get started.
First, let's understand some basic terminology.
1. Backups - Offsite backups powered by SnailDOS
2. Creatable Coins - Creatable coins allow you to buy better servers with more specs
3. Creatable Mining - Mining crypto in return of Creatable Coins
4. Our Software - Created by SnailDOS, software allows you to speed your productivity
## Software
Now we understand basic Creatable terminology, Let's get started by creating our first server.
You can create a server with our website but we highly recommend our software.
Currently, our support for software will not work on any apple devices.

## Setting up your own Discord bot
It's tons of things you need to do for this, and we recommend you ask for support in our discord server.
## Creatable Coins
You can buy creatable coins, join our discord and ask how.

You can also mine creatable coins by convering your PC processing power to mine Creatable coins.
If you want to mine Creatable coins, download the miner app, it works on linux, mac (m1), and Windows 10 and 11.
