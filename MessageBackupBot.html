<h1>Introduction to MessageBackupBot</h1>
<p>The MessageBackupBot, is the all-new discord bot, allowing guild messages to be backed up and restored. In this documentary, we will show you how to set it up and how to use it.</p>
<h1>Legal Documentation</h1>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>To start using the bot, you need to invite it by clicking <a href="https://messagebackup.snaildos.com">here.</a></p>
<p>Then, you want to select the “invite” link, and press “Invite To Your Server”. Please make sure you give it administrator or at least these permissions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manage Webhooks</li>
  <li>Manage Emojis and Stickers</li>
  <li>Send Messages</li>
  <li>Read Messages</li>
  <li>Manage Server</li>
  <li>Manage Channels</li>
  <li>Embed Links</li>
  <li>Attach Files</li>
  <li>Slash Commands</li>
</ul>
<p>Without these permissions, the bot will fail to work as expected.</p>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>After you added the bot to your discord server, please type in <code>/user register</code>. Then, confirm the agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once this is complete, you can run <code>/backups create</code> to create a new backup.</p>
<p>At any time, feel free to use <code>/user language</code> to change your language.</p>
<p>You can use <code>/backups load</code> to load your backup as well by supplying your encryption key.</p>
<p>Use the auto-fill discord feature to select your backups, to view and delete, type in <code>/backups delete</code></p>

<h1>Help! I got banned from discord!</h1>
<p>I am sorry, no matter what rank or how close you are to the community, we <strong>cannot.</strong> Let me repeat that, we <i><strong>CANNOT</strong></i><strong> ever restore your backup to your account, it's gone forever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You also CANNOT IMPORT an exported backup into another account.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a Discord enforcement, ignoring this will get us BANNED.</strong></p>
