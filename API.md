Endpoint is available at https://api.snaildos.com

------------------------------------------
00-responses
------------------------------

# General response

All responses follow a certain template that reports if the requested action was successful or not.

**All requests return a status property indicating if the action was successful or not**

# Successful actions

If an action is successful it follows this template under two conditions.

- If the requested action fetches a certain document from the database it returns all the data that is accessible based on the user privileges

  - For example, fetching a user:

    ```json
    {
      "status": true,
      "user": {
        "id": "string",
        "createdAt": "number",
        "scopes": "string[]",
        "email": "string",
        "name": "string",
        "verified": "boolean"
      }
    }
    ```

  /!\ This has a single exception which is the "fetch currently playing" endpoint. (Refer to the proper section of the documentation for more)

- If the requested action modifies, deletes, to posts a certain document from the database (for example, register user) it returns data that has been modified a consequence of the requested action or if the content was created it returns important data to access the newly created data

- For example, registering a new user:

  ```json
  {
    "status": true,
    "token": "string"
  }
  ```

# Failed actions

If an action has failed it follows this template under all conditions.

```jsonc
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "string"
  //...other properties may follow as details to what went wrong.
}
```

Failed actions provide an appropriate status code for what went wrong.

Some parts of the documentation may include status codes explaining the issues related to what went wrong
